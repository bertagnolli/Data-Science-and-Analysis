# Deep Learning Project: Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition
## Context
### The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

## Objective
### Our objective is to predict the number depicted inside the image by using Artificial or Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. We will go through various models of each and finally select the one that is giving us the best performance.
